Hello, I'm Alperen 👋

I'm studying Computer Engineering in Beykoz University.

I'm interested in computer hardware systems rather than software
but that doesn't mean I dont interested in software at all. 😃

I like learning as active different things about tech 💻

I also keen on civilian pilot and planes. ✈️

Like most of the computer fans I am playing some competitive video games. 🎮


- 🔭 I’m currently working on my University Projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, MsSQL, Linux, Computer Networks, OS, C/C++
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Jobs with working teamwork.
- 🔰 I'm using as OS generally Windows 8/8.1/10 and for developing Linux Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
