Hello, I'm Alperen 👋

I graduated with a degree in computer engineering from Beykoz University

I'm interested in computer hardware systems and networks 
rather than software but that doesn't mean I dont interested in software at all. 😃

I like learning as active different things about tech and IT System Administration(Network) 💻

I also keen on civilian pilot and planes. ✈️

Like most of the computer fans I am playing some competitive video games. 🎮
